# Chapter 2: Introduction to Python Progamming

## 2.1) Introduction
- Nothing notable here

<br>

## 2.2) Variables and Assignment Statements
- `x = 7` Whatever is to the right of the '=' will execute first
- `type(x)` will return the kind of data the value represents
- Note: variable names cannot start with a number

<br>

## 2.3) Arithmetic
1. Addition  +
2. Subtraction  -
3. Multiplication *
4. True Division / 
5. Floor division //
6. Exponentiation **
7. Remainder %
8. Sqaure root of x (x ** 1/2)
- Note PEMDAS applies to python mathematical equations

<br>

## 2.4) Function print and single/double quoted Strings
- `print('hello world')` or `print("Hello Wolrd")`
- `\n` insert a newline character
- `\t` insert a horizontal tab
- `\\` insert a backslash character in a string
- `\'` insert a single quote character into a string

- `Print("This is quite \ a long statement)` The \ allows you to type the print statement over multiple lines but will still display as one

<br>

## 2.5) Triple-Quoted Strings
- `print('Display "hi" in quotes)`
- `print('Display \'hi\' in quotes)`
- `print("""Display "hi" and 'bye' in quotes""")`

<br>

## 2.6) Getting Input from the User
- `name = input("What is your name?)` Note: input function is used, always returns a string
- `var = int(var2)` converts say a int variable taken in as a string using input back to an int

<br>

## 2.7) Decision Making: if statement and comparison
- Generally good practice to start each script should start with a docstring that explains the scripts purpose
ex.) """This is a script to do something of which I made it to do"""

<br>

## 2.8) Objects and Dynamic Typing
- Nothing to take note of

<br>

## 2.9) Intro to Data Science: Basic Descriptive Statistics
- Note the existence of the min, max built in function

<br>

## 2.19) Wrap up
- Nothing worth noting
