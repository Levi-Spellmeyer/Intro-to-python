# Introduction to Computers and Python

## 1.1) Introduction
- Nothing notable to write down

<br>

## 1.2) Hardware and Software
- Moore's Law: This is in regards to the increasing advancement of computers and how it is relatively inexpensive. The noted advancements are seen in the amount of memory, storage, and proccessor speed of computers
- Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU): part of the central proccessing unit

### self check for 1.2
1. Every year or two, the capacities of computers have approximately doubled inexpensively. This remarkable trend is often called ____      **Answer:** Moore's Law
2. Information in the memory unity is persistent-it's preserved even when the computer's power is turned off (T/F)      **Answer:** False memory is volatile and usually lost when power is turned off or disconnected abruptly
3. Most computers have ___ proccessors that implement mulitple processors on a single integrated circut chip. Such processors can perform many operation simultaneously.        **Answer:** Multicore

## 1.3) Data Hierarchy
- A record is a grouping of related fields where a field is a group of characters or bytes that convey meaning
- A file is a group of related records

### Self check for 1.3
- In some operating systems, a file is viewed simply as a sequence of bytes-any organization of the bytes in a file, such as organizing the data into records, is a view created by the application programmer. T/F     **Asnwer:** True

## 1.4) Machine Lnaguages, Assemply Languages and High-Level Langauages
- Machine languages: Generally consist of strings of numbers that instruct computers to perform operations one at a time. A particular machine language can be used on only one type of computer denoted as machine dependent.
- Assembly languages: English llike abbreviations to represent elementary operations. Asselblers translat assembly language programs to machine language at computer speeds.
- High-level languages: Single statements can be written to accomplis sunstantial tasks. These statements are called the programs source code. Compilers convery high level language source code to machine language.

## 1.5) Introduction to Object Technology
- Nothing to important to take note of as I have a book that will cover object oriented topics in relation to python

<br>

## 1.6) Operating Systems
- Covered different and common OS's as well as a few foundaions and organizations

## 1.7) Python
- Discussion of the attributes and applications of Python

## 1.8.1) Python standard Libraries
1. csv - proccessing comma-seperated value files
2. datetime,time - date and time manipulations
3. decimal - fixed/floating point arithmetic
4. doctest - simple unit testing via validation tests and expected results embedded in docstrings
5. json - json processing for uses with web services and databases
6. math - common math constants and operations
7. os - interacting with the operating system
8. timeit - performance analysis
9. queue - first in first out data structure
10. random - pseudorandom numbers
11. re -  regular expressions for pattern matching
12. sqlite3 - relation database access
13. statistics - mathematical stat functions like mean, median, and variance
14. string - string processing
15. sys - command line argument processsing; standard input/output/error streams

<br>

## 1.8.2) Data-Science Libraries
1. Numpy - provides ndarray data structure to represent lists and matrices
2. Matplotlib - visualization and plotting library
3. Pandas - data manipulations. series and data frames
4. TensorFlow - used in deep learning. Works with GPUs for performance. Important in AI.

<br>

## 1.9) Other popular Programming Languages
- Nothing to notable relating to python

<br>

## 1.10) Test-Drives: Using IPython and Jupyter Notebooks
- Covered IPython which I used in the anaconda terminal as well as jupyter labs

## 1.11 through rest of the chapter are more conceptual on topics such as AI and big data. Nothing notable in relation to python
