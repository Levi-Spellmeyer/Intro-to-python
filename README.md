# Coding with Python
This repository will contain notes and examples from my time following the curriculum laid out by the:
1. Udemy Python Mega Course
2. Intro to Python book
---
My goal while following along with this resources is to further develop my understanding of python as I want it to be the programming language that I know best. While I have working knowledge
of othe programming languages, I think it is important to have obtain a higher understanding of at least 1 language.
